### Understanding American Express Gift Cards

American Express gift cards are prepaid cards that can be used wherever American Express is accepted, including online retailers. These cards come preloaded with a specific amount and function like credit or debit cards, but with some limitations that require careful navigation when shopping on Amazon.

### Steps to Use an American Express Gift Card on Amazon

#### Step 1: Register Your American Express Gift Card
Before you can use your American Express gift card online, it’s crucial to register it. Registering the card links it to a billing address, which is often required for online transactions.

2. Visit the website or call the number to register your card.
3. Enter your card details, including the card number, expiration date, and CVV.
4. Add a billing address to complete the registration.

Once registered, your American Express gift card is ready for use.

#### Step 2: Check the Balance on Your American Express Gift Card
Amazon does not allow split payments between multiple cards, so it’s essential to ensure your gift card balance is sufficient for the intended purchase.

1. Visit the American Express gift card balance website or call the customer service number listed on the back of the card.

If your American Express gift card balance is less than the item you wish to purchase, consider converting it into an Amazon gift card. Here’s how:

1. Go to the Amazon gift card purchase page.
2. Select the amount you want to load onto the Amazon gift card (equal to or less than your Amex gift card balance).
3. Enter your email address to receive the gift card code.
